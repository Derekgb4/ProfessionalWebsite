		<div class="w3-row-padding w3-center w3-margin-top">

					<h3>Mountain Path</h3><br>
					<i class="fa fa-desktop w3-margin-bottom w3-text-theme" style="font-size:120px"></i>
					<p>Created a program which would take an elevation map and find the path to cross the mountain which had the least change in elevation across the mountain</p>
					<p>The program would output a map of the mountain with the least path highlighted across the mountain</p>
					<p>C++</p>
				</div>

			<div class="w3-third">
				<div class="w3-card w3-container" style="min-height:460px">
					<h3>Statistical Analysis of numerical data</h3><br>
					<i class="fa fa-desktop w3-margin-bottom w3-text-theme" style="font-size:120px"></i>
					<p>Created a menu-driven application to aid with dealing with different types of given data.</p>
					<p>Given a text file of numerical data the program can give back various statistical quantities associated with the data</p>
					<p>MATLAB</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-third">
				<div class="w3-card w3-container" style="min-height:460px">
					<h3>Indexer</h3><br>
					<i class="fa fa-desktop w3-margin-bottom w3-text-theme" style="font-size:120px"></i>
					<p>Created a program which would take in a text file and create an index of all the words.</p>
					<p>The program took a text file of words to ignore. And output an alphabetical index which would list how many times each word was written, and on which pages it was written.</p>
					<p>Java</p>

			I do not have a ton of experience with coding, but I enjoy it very much and love the challenge of any project. I really want to be able to make a change in the world. I want to better people's lives through the advancement of technology. 
			Even if I cannot directly be involved in the advancement in technology, I want to be part of making the world running and what better way to do that in a world run by computers than by coding and manufacturing.
